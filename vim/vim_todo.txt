Vim Todo

BUGS
* Leader-vn is hanging until timeout for coc rename
* autopair brackets - in config file, if {<CR> slowly, it fills in with funny stuff - stop it!
  also for python reconsider the alignment (for {<CR>, tab too large and closing brackets should be on sep line pos 1)
* In GCP vim, delete key sometimes doesn't work in insert mode
* jl to escape insert mode will move cursor left afterwards
* exit terminal requires manual :bd (because of .profile) unless add .profile to .bashrc
* Sometimes can't bksp in insert mode
* Land inside autoclose of surround chars - move cursor inside quotes after autoclose (or just use jh/jl?)
* Commenting should start at first nonws char, not col pos 1 (works in vim)
* Ensure coc organize imports works - See https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/issues/4372

GROOMED BACKLOG

From lazyvim video on mac,
in ~/Library/Application_Support/lazygit/config.yml...
        ```

OLD VIM VERSIONS
* fix sign column toggle for vim 7.4-
      see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18319284/vim-sign-column-toggle
* Add support for old (cavim) versions, eg https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim

WINDOWS
* Add a <leader> version of <C-W> commands
* Can we synchronize split window content? What does that mean, and when useful? Eg merge conflicts or diff windows?

TESTS
* Code and unit test - fast process

IPYTHON
* Add vim-ipython-cell (run cells inside .py files in Vim)
      and/or jupyter console with script to start kernel and connect to it (lastest one)
