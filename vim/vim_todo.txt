Vim Todo

PRIORITIES
* Implement Fugitive
  - use learndog version
  - add helper_fzf_fugitive.vim (and source it conditionally on fzf and fugtive)
    with configuration for BCommits and Commits
  - Fix usage for BCommits and Commits (if nec)

BUGS
* autopair brackets - in config file, if {<CR> slowly, it fills in with funny stuff - stop it!
  also for python reconsider the alignment (for {<CR>, tab too large and closing brackets should be on sep line pos 1)
* In GCP vim, delete key sometimes doesn't work in insert mode

KEYMAPS
* Reorg keymaps by helper file (including overwrites to document keymap and add whichkey text)
      Confirm that disable, which-key and vim-which-key have compatible formats
* Add organize imports with coc with keymap for ":call CocAction('runCommand', 'editor.action.organizeImport')"
* Add <Leader>vv for :view $VIMRC    (read only)
* Add block alignment script and keymap
          esp for docstrings like 'parameter:      mytext'
* Page (or 1/2 or 2/3 page) up and down keeping cursor in middle of page (see old configs)
          or simply add "M" after full page scroll
* Remove keymaps that cause muscle memory to change text (never map Ctrl-s, Ctrl-x or Ctrl-z)
* Keymap to set a .vimrc paramter for color theme
* Use del key to delete without yank (and update copypaste hint at top of this .vimrc file)
* Add a keymap to trigger WhichKey from visual line mode

FZF SEARCH
* Help files
* Keymap and verbose(where keybind def) keymap searches using vim-which-key.
        See https://jay-baker.com/posts/vim-1-which-key/
* :[b|p|d]Lines and :[b|p|d]Files  (b=curr buffer, bb=open buff files, p=project, d=specify dir)
* :Commits and :BCommits commands with Fugitive as in
        https://bluz71.github.io/2018/12/04/fuzzy-finding-in-vim-with-fzf.html
        Try other fzf - pattern match, key maps, MRU files sorted by MRU (eg last accessed time) or alpha,
        diagnostiics, current buffer files, file content etc
        MRU or same dir files...  nnoremap <silent> <Space>. :Files <C-r>=expand("%:h")<CR>/<CR>
* Add :verbose map
* fzf key bindings (and verbose version of fzf keymaps)
* :Files search with dotfiles included
* Find all vim swap files in dir or git project

BROWSER
* TUI browsers with and without javascript

GIT
* Integrate with git diff?
* git mergetool keymap for select local/remote/base (OR lazygit? magit? github.com/mkchoi212/fac?)
* Synch scroll for git blame sidebar

STATUS LINE
* Add filetype to status line
* Add git branch name to status line (see lightline info about using vim-gitbranch, or maybe fugitive)

FILE EXPLORER
* Open file explorer using vim cwd OR curr buff file dir OR proj dir
* :cd to project top level folder or to current buffer file location
* TUI FIle manager... https://terminaltrove.com/superfile/, ranger, mc,...  (outside of VIM can launch in vim?)
* launch external file TUI at curr dir / proj folder
* Add nvim-tree.lua for nvim (https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua) no deps but nice

BUFFERS AND TABS
* Keymaps for next and previous tab... gt or gT
* Buffer and tab rename
* Open buffers as new tabs (if not already a tab)
* Close all tabs (wihtout error on last one) but keep buffers
* Open a file in new split or tab (after selecting in netrw also?)

LANGUAGE SERVER
* format on save; format a project folder
* coc working folders (and see other items in :CocList)

FILE DIFFS
* Integrate with external diff, colordiff, nbdiff, difftastic, vimdiff, github.com/dandavison/delta
        Also see github.com/whiteinge/diffconflicts for vim-diffconflicts

TERMINALS (<Leader>t)
* Keymaps for :terminal, :vertical terminal, :vertical <modifier> terminal,
      where <modifier> is... lefta[bove], abo[veleft], bel[owright], rightb[elow]
      See https://www.baeldung.com/linux/vim-terminal-open-position
* Keymaps for :tab terminal

SNIPPETS
* Simple manual snippets (and keep in git - manual updates get pushed, no on-the-fly additions)

OLD VIM VERSIONS
* fix sign column toggle for vim 7.4-
      see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18319284/vim-sign-column-toggle
* Add support for old (cavim) versions, eg https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim

NATIVE NVIM
* Nvim compatibility
* Commenting should start at first nonws char, not col pos 1 (works in vim)
* Ensure coc organize imports works - See https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/issues/4372
* Try debug capabilities

TMUX SUPPORT
* Fix Ctrl-arrows and status line colors for vim running in tmux

WINDOWS
* Better splits and windows - see https://github.com/Aster89/WinZoZ/tree/main
* Add a <leader> version of <C-W> commands
* Can we synchronize split window content? What does that mean, and when useful? Eg merge conflicts or diff windows?

TESTS
* Code and unit test - fast process

DEBUG
* Debug python in terminal
        See www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/jg91dt/using_termdebug_for_pythons_pdb_examples/
* Try vimspector... https://github.com/puremourning/vimspector

IPYTHON
* Add vim-ipython-cell (run cells inside .py files in Vim)
      and/or jupyter console with script to start kernel and connect to it (lastest one)
        See locally saved discussion
        and see code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py
        and see stackoverflow.com/questions/64730660/how-do-i-find-excute-python-interactive-mode-in-visual-studio-code

      Edit and run Jupyter notebooks from Vim or Neovim
         1. **Molten and Quarto**: Molten is a plugin that enables a notebook-like code running experience¹. It can start Jupyter kernels or attach to already running kernels, run code with those
         2. **Jupyter-Vim**: This is a two-way integration between Vim and Jupyter². It allows you to develop code on a Jupyter notebook without leaving the terminal². You can send lines from Vim
         3. **Vim-Notebook**: This plugin allows you to edit `.ipynb` files locally using Vim³.
         4. **Vimpyter**: This is another plugin that allows you to edit your Jupyter notebooks in Vim/Neovim⁴.
         5. **Jupytext.vim**: This Vim plugin allows you to edit Jupyter `.ipynb` files⁵. Make sure that you have the `jupytext` CLI program installed (`pip install jupytext`)⁵.

PLUGIN MANAGEMENT
* Use specified commit or version for plugins
* Use forked fugitive, maximizer, tmuxvimnavigator, whichkey, autoformat, ...
* Fix or confirm proper plugin branches are available and installed in the forked repos
        To ensure that the forked versions of coc.nvim and coc-pyright are installed,
        you can specify the URL of your forked repositories in your .vimrc file.
        Here’s an example of how you can do this:
          Replace 'your-username' with your GitHub username
          Plug 'your-username/coc.nvim', {'branch': 'master', 'do': 'yarn install --frozen-lockfile'}
          Plug 'your-username/coc-pyright', {'branch': 'master', 'do': 'yarn install --frozen-lockfile'}
          or Plug 'fannheyward/coc-pyright', {'do': 'yarn install --frozen-lockfile'}
        After updating your .vimrc file, you can run :PlugInstall to install the plugins from your forked
        repositories. You don’t need to run :CocInstall coc-pyright since you have already
        specified the forked repositories in your .vimrc file.
* Add plusin required dependencies documentation
